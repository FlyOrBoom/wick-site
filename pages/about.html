	<p>Wick is a free browser-based toolkit for making animations, games, and everything in between. It's built to make it as simple as possible to get a thing on a screen to do something and publish your creations online.</p>

	<p>Wick is a hybrid of an animation tool and a coding environment, heavily inspired by similar tools such as Flash, HyperCard, and Scratch. It was developed in response to a growing need for such a tool for the modern web. You can read more about the creation of Wick <a href="https://medium.com/@zrispo/wick-bringing-the-spirit-of-flash-to-the-modern-web-aad9ba3ce978">here</a>.</p>
