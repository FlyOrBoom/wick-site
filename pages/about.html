	<p>Wick is a free browser-based toolkit for making animations, games, and everything in between. It's built to make it as simple as possible to get something on screen to do something, and publish your project online.</p>

	<p>Wick is a hybrid of an animation tool and a coding environment, heavily inspired by similar tools such as Flash, HyperCard, and Scratch. It was developed in response to a growing need for such a tool for the modern web. You can read more about the creation of Wick here.</p>

	<p>Wick was created and is currently led by Zach Rispoli and Luca Damasco.</p>

	<p>Branding and interface design by Anna Gusman.</p>
